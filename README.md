# focus-tasks
A modern, human-centric todo list web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focused on clean design, smooth interactions, and persistent task management using LocalStorage.

Think like a real senior frontend engineer and product designer.

Your job is to build a MODERN, ADVANCED, and HUMAN-CENTRIC TODO LIST
that feels like a REAL PRODUCT someone would actually enjoy using —
not a tutorial project.

This project must be built using ONLY:
✔ HTML5
✔ CSS3
✔ Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Absolutely NO:
❌ React
❌ Vue
❌ Angular
❌ Bootstrap
❌ Tailwind
❌ jQuery
❌ Backend or server logic

This is a frontend-only, offline-first application.
Use LocalStorage for all persistence.

=================================================
HOW THIS TODO APP SHOULD FEEL
=================================================

This is NOT just a task list.

It should feel like:
• A personal productivity space
• Calm, focused, and well designed
• Smart enough to reduce thinking for the user
• Responsive and smooth on every device
• Built with care, not rushed

When someone opens this app, they should feel:
“Ah, this is clean, simple, and easy to use.”

=================================================
CORE USER EXPERIENCE (VERY IMPORTANT)
=================================================

1. The interface must be clean and modern
2. Nothing should feel cluttered
3. Every interaction should give visual feedback
4. Animations should feel natural, not flashy
5. The user should always understand what’s happening

=================================================
TODO FUNCTIONALITY (ADVANCED BUT PRACTICAL)
=================================================

• Add a task (with validation – no empty tasks)
• Mark task as completed (smooth animation)
• Edit task inline (no pop-ups unless needed)
• Delete task (with confirmation)
• Clear all completed tasks

Each task should support:
• Priority (Low / Medium / High)
• Optional due date
• Completion status

=================================================
SMART PRODUCTIVITY FEATURES
=================================================

• Task counters:
  - Total tasks
  - Completed tasks
  - Pending tasks

• Filters:
  - All
  - Completed
  - Pending
  - Priority-based

• Live search:
  - As user types, tasks filter smoothly

• Persistent state:
  - Refreshing the page must NOT lose data
  - Closing the browser must NOT lose data

=================================================
LOCAL STORAGE STRATEGY
=================================================

All data must be stored using LocalStorage.

The data structure should be:
• Clean
• Readable
• Easy to extend later

The app should:
• Load tasks on startup
• Save tasks immediately after every change
• Never feel “reset” unexpectedly

=================================================
DESIGN & UI DIRECTION (HUMAN, NOT GENERIC)
=================================================

• Modern and minimal visual style
• Card-based task layout (not boring lists)
• Soft shadows and rounded corners
• Calm color palette
• Clear typography
• Subtle gradients or depth (optional)
• Dark / Light mode is a bonus

Tasks should feel “touchable” and alive.

=================================================
ANIMATIONS & MICRO-INTERACTIONS
=================================================

• Smooth page load animation
• Task add animation (slide / fade)
• Task complete animation (checkbox or strike-through)
• Task delete animation (smooth removal)
• Button hover feedback
• Filter switch animation

Animations must feel:
✔ Natural
✔ Subtle
✔ Purposeful

=================================================
RESPONSIVENESS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
=================================================

• Mobile-first design
• Touch-friendly buttons
• Perfect layout on:
  - Mobile
  - Tablet
  - Laptop
  - Desktop
• No horizontal scrolling bugs

=================================================
JAVASCRIPT CODE QUALITY EXPECTATIONS
=================================================

• Clean, readable functions
• Meaningful variable and function names
• Modular logic
• Event delegation where appropriate
• No duplicated logic
• Comments only where logic is complex

Code should look like:
“I can understand this even after 6 months.”

=================================================
PROJECT STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
=================================================

/todo-app/
│── index.html
│── css/
│   └── style.css
│── js/
│   └── script.js

=================================================
DELIVERABLES
=================================================

1. Complete index.html (semantic & accessible)
2. Complete style.css (modern, responsive, animated)
3. Complete script.js (clean logic + LocalStorage)
4. Short explanation of how the app works
5. Professional README content for GitHub
6. Resume-ready project description

=================================================
FINAL QUALITY STANDARD
=================================================

This project MUST:
❌ Not look like a YouTube tutorial
❌ Not look like a basic student project
❌ Not feel rushed or unfinished

This project MUST:
✅ Feel polished
✅ Feel thoughtful
✅ Feel human
✅ Feel product-ready
✅ Impress frontend recruiters
